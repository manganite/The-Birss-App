# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Scientific correction (rank-4 forms of the trigonal and hexagonal groups).** For
  point groups with a 3- or 6-fold axis, the in-plane block of a fourth-rank tensor
  couples several independent components through one relation that Birss prints as a
  sum (Table 4f row L4: `xxxx = yyxx + xyyx + yxyx`). The projector returned a
  redundant family list for exactly these cells, and two things downstream were wrong
  in all versions up to and including **v0.23.0**:
  - **Simulator, EQ source terms and polarimetry (quantitatively wrong):** each tensor
    component was attributed to a single independent parameter times a fixed ratio,
    which is only valid when components are locked in proportion. In the coupled
    in-plane blocks it is not, and the tensor the sliders actually built was **not
    invariant** under the group's own 3-/6-fold rotation (it violated
    `χ_xxxx = χ_xxyy + χ_xyxy + χ_xyyx`). EQ polarimetry computed for a trigonal or
    hexagonal group with an earlier version should be recomputed. Components now show
    as genuine sums over the parameters they depend on, e.g.
    `Q_xx = (χ_xxxx + ½χ_xxyy)E_x² + …`, and there is one slider per independent
    parameter.
  - **Calculator and Tables component relations (misleading display):** the affected
    forms listed overlapping relation chains that contradicted one another as
    simultaneous equations — for `3m` at rank 4 they implied `χ_xxxx = 0` while the
    same panel counted that component as non-vanishing. The relation list is now a
    consistent constraint set: one chain per group of proportional components, plus
    any residual composite relation in Birss's printed form on its own line.
  Independent-component **counts were always correct** and are unchanged, as are all
  ED and MD outputs (bit for bit) and every non-trigonal/hexagonal rank-4 form. The
  elasticity and photoelasticity forms in the Tables page are affected in the same way
  and equally corrected. Details:
  `docs/findings/FINDING-2026-07-29-rank4-trigonal-hexagonal-overcount.md`.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- Accessibility: the ARIA tab widgets (Help sections, Simulator polarimetry
  configuration) now implement the full keyboard pattern -- roving tabindex plus
  ArrowLeft/ArrowRight (wrapping) and Home/End moving and activating tabs; the five
  numeric text inputs next to the sliders regain a visible focus outline (the
  `focus:outline-none` suppression is removed); the sliders' existing keyboard
  contract (native fine steps, Shift+Arrow coarse steps) is now pinned by
  interaction tests.
- Accessibility (A2 walkthrough): the crystal-cut legend toggle gets a robust
  accessible name and toggle state (`aria-label` + `aria-pressed`; previously
  title-only), the mobile slider layout gains the same Shift+Arrow coarse-step
  handlers as the desktop layout, and the view switcher becomes a `<nav
  aria-label="Main">` landmark.

### Fixed

- Simulator sliders: repeated Shift+Arrow coarse steps no longer accumulate
  floating-point noise -- the keyboard path now snaps its result through the same
  detent logic (`snapValue`) as dragging, so every coarse step lands exactly on the
  0.05 / 15-degree grid.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Performance: the Tables page no longer freezes when selecting a rank-4 tensor or opening the
  "Groups sharing this form" list. The symmetry-form projector was rewritten with an allocation-free
  flat-array hot path (identical results), cutting a cold rank-4 form from ~256 ms to ~14 ms and the
  122-group signature sweep from ~19.5 s to ~0.7 s; and the "sharing this form" partition is now
  precomputed at build time (`npm run sharingdata`) so opening the list is an O(1) lookup instead of
  a main-thread sweep. No change to any computed tensor form. Overall test-suite runtime is down as
  well (~66 s to ~60 s).
- Accessibility: the tab widgets (Help sections, Simulator polarimetry configuration) now expose
  `role="tablist"/"tab"/"tabpanel"` with `aria-selected` and
  `aria-controls`/`aria-labelledby`; the main navigation marks the active view with
  `aria-current="page"`; and the Simulator's amplitude/phase/angle sliders and number inputs carry
  `aria-label`s. Declarative only (no keyboard-navigation change); purely additive ARIA attributes,
  rendered output otherwise unchanged (E24).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Tables page: the index-symmetry selector now offers the first-pair symmetry `(ij)k` at rank 3 and a
  pairs-only `(ij)(kl)` symmetry at rank 4 (the photoelastic / electrostriction case) alongside full
  `(ij)(kl) sym` Voigt symmetry. Forms with a compressible index pair render as a Voigt-compressed
  matrix -- 6x3 for rank-3 `(ij)k`, 6x6 for the rank-4 pair symmetries (header order XX YY ZZ YZ ZX
  XY) -- with genuine sums shown correctly (e.g. the hexagonal c66 = (c11 - c12)/2).
- Tables page: the "Groups sharing this form" list is grouped by point-group type -- colourless
  (Type I), grey (Type II), black-white (Type III).
- Explorer group popup: a "Polar directions" block -- the polar (symmetry) axes and nonpolar
  direction sets for the group (ITC Vol. D Table 3.2.2.2), each nonpolar set labelled by its ITC
  2.1.3.1 symmetry-direction class. Centrosymmetric groups show "no polar directions"; magnetic
  groups reuse their unprimed spatial skeleton's directions (with a note that primes act spatially).
  The three 30 deg-divergent trigonal classes (32, 3m, -6m2) and their derivatives carry a Birss
  -frame note, and the 622 print omission in Table 3.2.2.2 is corrected (the [uv0] set restored, with
  a footnote). The row choice is machine-verified against the app's own operators.
- Explorer group popup: the lattice info now shows the crystal system's cell-parameter restrictions,
  free ("to be determined") parameters, and Bravais lattice symbols (ITC Vol. A Table 2.1.1.1), with
  monoclinic c-unique and trigonal family-vs-system notes.
- Vendored ITC reference tables 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.3.1 under `docs/references/` (alongside 3.2.2.1 /
  3.2.2.2 from the previous change), with drift + operator-consistency guards on the derived data.

- Help: a new "Tables" tab documents the Tables page end to end -- the two lookup modes and the four
  result blocks, how to choose a tensor (rank, spatial/time parity and index symmetry, via the parity
  product rule) with the effect catalogue, the classical two-step Table-4a chain (with a worked
  quartz example), and the magnetic c-tensor Table-7 route (recipe, cross-formula, three worked
  examples). Two new Deeper Topics entries -- "Voigt symmetry and Voigt notation" and "Table 7:
  reading the letter columns directly".
- Tables page: a collapsible lookup-chain diagram under the breadcrumb -- a monochrome picture of the
  route (the A/B fork, the Table-4a row read with the parity crossover marked, the rotated-setting
  badge, and the final rank-table row); it also illustrates the three worked examples in the Help
  Tables tab. Tooltips on every selector, effect chip, result block and lookup-chain segment.
- Tables page: the lookup-chain breadcrumb now renders the full Birss Table-7 chain for c-tensors of
  magnetic (Type III) groups instead of a "chain display planned" placeholder. It shows the c-column,
  the associated classical group A/B (with a rotated-setting badge when the source uses alternate
  axes), that source's reference axes, which Table-4a column is read (making the parity crossover
  explicit), the class letter, and the final rank-table row -- plus a footnote on the two documented
  Birss Table-7 misprints. Grey (Type II) c-tensors show that time reversal alone forbids the tensor.
- Testing: vendored four transcribed ITC reference tables (Vol. D 3.2.2.1 property counts and 3.2.2.2
  polar axes; Vol. A 2.1.3.1 symmetry directions and 2.1.1.1 crystal systems) under `docs/references/`,
  and an anti-circular guard holding `computeTensorForm` to ITC Table 3.2.2.1 -- the independent
  -component counts and property occurrence for the 21 noncentrosymmetric classical classes (rank-1
  pyroelectric, rank-3 piezoelectric/SHG, axial rank-2 optical activity), the 11 centrosymmetric Laue
  groups vanishing, the printed structural totals, the setting-mapped rank-1 polar-axis directions,
  and the enantiomorphism column. The vendored 3.2.2.2 records the print-confirmed 622 omission.

### Changed

- Tables page: the result section is titled "Tensor form"; the lookup-chain diagram's connectors
  follow the layout flow (right between side-by-side chips on desktop, down when stacked).
- Effect citations: the classical effects (pyroelectricity, permittivity, piezoelectricity,
  elasticity) now cite ITC Vol. D (with DOI) instead of Birss ch. 4 (the magnetic-properties
  chapter); the magnetic effects keep Birss ch. 4 and gain the ITC DOI.
- Tables page: the lookup mode toggle shows "By tensor type" (the core function) before "By effect".
- Testing: added a class-indexed Table-7 guard putting `computeTensorForm` under Birss's i-/c-tensor
  cross-formula at ranks 0/1/2/4 (Tables 4b/4c/4d/4f) for all 58 black-white groups, backed by a
  generated `table7Data.ts` (codegen from `table-7.md`, `npm run table7data`). This subsumes the
  planned "magnetic EQ rank-4 golden fixtures" backlog item at the symbol-class level (Table-4f
  even-rank c-tensors are now anchored for every class that appears in the black-white rows).
- Tooling (tech-debt Wave 1): added ESLint (flat config, `typescript-eslint` + `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`,
  hooks-deps / unused-vars as errors and the recommended sets as warnings) and Prettier, wired as
  `lint:eslint` + `format:check` CI steps; a one-time repo-wide Prettier reformat (no logic changes);
  switched CI/deploy to `npm ci` and exact-pinned the toolchain deps (`vite`, `vitest`, `vite-plugin-pwa`,
  `@types/react*`) to their lockfile versions; and added non-blocking V8 coverage
  (`@vitest/coverage-v8`, `npm run test:coverage`) with a recorded baseline (lines 86.72%, branches 74.45%).
- Docs: corrected the `SectionHeader` entry in `AGENTS.md` (actual home `notation.tsx`, classes
  `text-xs … text-ink/70`); renamed the misnamed `itcData.reference.test.ts` to
  `polarDirections.reference.test.ts`. The 2026-07-11 tech-debt audit's actionable items are now
  tracked as an `E#` series in `docs/planning/TODO-next.md`.

### Removed

- Dead `getFutureSettingCount` stub (backed by an always-empty `GROUPS_WITH_FUTURE_SETTINGS`, so it
  could only ever return `null`) and its two no-op render branches in the operations and group-identity
  headers. No user-visible change.

### Fixed

- Symbolic SHG source-term formulas for electric-quadrupole (EQ) tensors on the point groups with a
  3- or 6-fold axis (`3m`, `6mm`, `-6m2`, `-3'm`) were wrong at off-normal incidence (generic tilt /
  azimuth) — a few-percent error that vanished at normal incidence. The cause was a stale-snapshot bug
  in the `cos²+sin²=1` simplifier of the symbolic trig-polynomial algebra; the live numeric Simulator
  path and the displayed formulas at normal incidence were unaffected. Anyone who copied a symbolic EQ
  formula for one of these groups at a nonzero tilt/azimuth should regenerate it. Guarded by golden
  fixtures (independently confirmed from first principles) and an extended symbolic↔numeric agreement
  sweep at generic angles (backlog item E1).

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Tables page "By effect" mode: pick a named physical effect (pyroelectricity, spontaneous
  magnetization, permittivity, the linear magnetoelectric effect, piezoelectricity, piezomagnetism,
  elasticity) to see its symmetry-reduced form with the effect's own symbol and defining equation.
  Allowed property chips in the Explorer popup now deep-link into the matching effect, and a
  collapsible "Groups sharing this form" list shows every group with the same frame-canonical form.

### Fixed

- Tables page: the lookup-chain breadcrumb no longer shows the classical Table-4a tail for magnetic
  c-tensors (where Birss's lookup runs via Table 7) -- it previously could contradict the displayed
  form.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- New "Tables" page: interactive Birss-table lookup -- choose any tensor by rank (0-4), spatial
  parity and time parity (plus intrinsic index symmetry) and see its symmetry-reduced form for
  the selected group, with the Birss lookup chain (family class, reference axes, table row) and
  an "Open in Tables" button in the Explorer popup. Print-anchored via the Phase-1 engine.
  Help and README document the Tables page.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Explorer group popup: Shubnikov symbol (classical and black-and-white groups, from the
  print-verified Birss tables with anti-drift guard tests), group order, parent group with
  halving subgroup, per-setting labels with Birss/ITC standards, and the Birss reference-axis
  orientation of the group's classical family.
- Explorer group popup: full Hermann-Mauguin symbol for all groups and Shubnikov symbols for the
  grey groups, both sourced from the canonical `table-nomenclature.md` with entry-for-entry
  anti-drift guard tests.
- Explorer group popup: a Properties block (Laue class, chirality, and allowed/forbidden flags
  for polar/pyro-ferroelectric, piezoelectric, ferromagnetic, piezomagnetic and linear
  magnetoelectric behaviour), each flag anchored against printed references (ITC Tables 1.5.2.4,
  1.5.7.1, 1.5.8.1; classical property classes; Schmid 1994 counts).

### Fixed

- The symmetry-type box claimed "ED SHG allowed" for every non-centrosymmetric group; for the
  432 family the ED SHG tensor vanishes identically. The consequence is now derived from the
  computed tensor form (wrong text shipped in v0.16.0-v0.17.x).

- Explorer popup: info tooltips no longer get clipped (rendered through a portal -- applies
  app-wide to all info tooltips); wider layout with a two-column info grid; Full HM shown for
  every group; redundant pyro/ferroelectric footnote removed.

- Simulator: the "As functions of θ_pol" label no longer uppercases the math symbol.

### Changed

- Explorer popup: the settings row now lists the active convention's standard frame first and
  annotates frames as "standard frame in Birss/ITC" (clarifying that the annotation names the
  frame choice, not the symbol's notation); when both conventions share the standard frame the two
  annotations merge into "standard frame in Birss and ITC".

- Simulator's Mathematical Model box and the Help intensity derivation now use one notation
  (incident E^ω; intensities written directly as squared source-term projections, no detected
  E^2ω quantity) and link to each other; the Help derivation leads with the general intensity
  formula and drops redundant repetition.

- Help page reworked after a content review: settings and symbol-convention documentation moved
  to Notations & Conventions and crystal rotation to Simulation (Deeper Topics now holds only
  deep dives, with cross-references); added symmetry-operation notation (subscript/superscript),
  a components-and-phases box, the Haussuehl reference, and overview mentions of the convention
  toggle and system info panel; fixed a broken formula, stale rotation-angle symbols, the psi
  description, and the one-sided monoclinic frame description; unified Gray/grey and
  crystal-vs-lab axis casing.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Explorer: a per-crystal-system info panel (lattice conditions, defining symmetry, HM symbol
  positions, settings, Birss-vs-ITC notes, holohedry, example material), with the axis-orientation
  box integrated into it.

### Fixed

- Polarimetry tab tooltip title is no longer invisible when its tab is selected.
- Help: two glossary "Learn more" links now point at the tab that actually contains the topic;
  added missing Crystal Cut and Group Types sections; updated the Alternate Settings and Symbol
  Conventions sections to the current UI (global convention toggle, no badges, new setting-button
  labels). README rotation-control symbols corrected (phi_X/phi_Y/psi) and the global convention
  toggle documented.

- Corrected the triclinic/monoclinic component note (it said "monoclinic" even when a triclinic
  group was selected) and moved it below the component sliders instead of above. Polarimetry tab
  tooltips (Anisotropy/Polarizer/Analyzer) no longer render clipped behind the plot. The selected
  polarimetry tab now highlights its info icon together with the tab instead of leaving it light
  against the dark tab. Display-only.

- Crystal-rotation sliders/tooltip now label the lab-axis tilts as `φ_X` / `φ_Y` (previously
  `φ_x` / `φ_y`, which read as crystal axes even though the tilt is about the lab frame).
- Crystal-cut buttons now show every correct designation per direction (`[hkl]` and/or Cartesian
  x/y/z and/or crystallographic a/b/c), corrected for triclinic and monoclinic (setting-aware:
  c-unique vs b-unique) where the old `[hkl]` labels were wrong for a Cartesian axis that has no
  simple Miller-index expression. Labels and the `getPresetsForSystem` API only — no computed
  value (tensor, source term, cut direction) changes for a given input.
- Axis-box legend text now points to the AXIS ORIENTATION box (per crystal system and setting)
  instead of a single hard-coded convention.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- Route-level code splitting: the Help, Simulator, and Calculator pages are now lazy-loaded
  (`React.lazy`/`Suspense`), and vendor libraries (`react`/`react-dom`, `katex`/`react-katex`,
  `motion`) build into their own chunks. The single ~1,089 kB production bundle is now several
  chunks, each under Vite's 500 kB warning threshold, and vendor code can cache independently
  of app code across deploys.
- All group symbols, Schoenflies symbols, setting-button labels, and symmetry-operation lists now
  render through the LaTeX formatter (previously plain text in several places).
- Raised the minimum UI font size and the minimum secondary-text contrast app-wide (decorative
  elements unchanged).
- The Birss/ITC symbol convention is now a global mode (header toggle) instead of a per-group
  control. It relabels group names app-wide (Explorer, search, Calculator, Simulator) for the two
  groups whose standard symbol differs between conventions (`m'm'm`/`mm'm'`, `6'/mm'm`/`6'/mmm'`),
  opens groups on the active convention's standard frame, and persists across reloads. This
  supersedes the v0.15.0 "`m'm'm` badge-only, no relabel" decision.
- Setting buttons now show the frame's Hermann-Mauguin symbol (with an axis qualifier for
  monoclinic/orthorhombic); the previous "Default"/"standard" badges were removed — the selected
  setting is the standard. Orthorhombic frame symbols are now shown (verified, stored).
- The axis-convention explanations (trigonal/hexagonal HM position-2 rule; monoclinic c-/b-unique
  settings) moved from mode-only inline notes into an info tooltip on the AXIS ORIENTATION header,
  available for every crystal system in both conventions.
- Group info header reworked: the title now shows the group name (constant across settings, only
  convention-dependent) and the redundant cross-convention synonym was removed; the Crystal
  System / Symmetry Type / Axis Orientation boxes share a uniform title-on-top layout (Symmetry
  Type gains an icon and the ED-SHG consequence); the Crystal Setting selector moved into the
  info box for both Calculator and Simulator; minor alignment fixes; the info header is now shown
  on mobile in the Simulator too, so the setting selector is reachable there.
- Explorer: crystal-system tabs now span the full width; the group preview popup header matches the
  Calculator/Simulator info header (group name shown correctly per convention, synonym dropped,
  symmetry type and convention added).

### Fixed

- Grey (Type II) trigonal/hexagonal/tetragonal groups showed their alternate crystal-setting
  symbol without the `1'` grey suffix (e.g. `-31m` instead of `-31m1'` for `-3m1'`). Corrected for
  `-42m1'`, `321'`, `3m1'`, `-3m1'`, `-6m21'`. Display-only; no tensor output changes.
- PWA build config (`vite-plugin-pwa`'s `includeAssets`) referenced `favicon.ico`,
  `apple-touch-icon.png`, and `mask-icon.svg`, none of which exist in `public/`. Now lists
  the SVG icons that actually ship (`favicon.svg`, `icon-192.svg`, `icon-512.svg`), matching
  the manifest's own icon list.
- Section-header info tooltips (Symbol Convention, Crystal Setting) were rendered uppercase,
  over-tracked, and at 50% opacity because they were nested inside a dimmed section header; they
  are now legible, matching the other tooltips.
- The monoclinic AXIS ORIENTATION display now follows the active setting: it showed a fixed
  c-unique frame (z∥c) even in the ITC / b-unique setting, where the unique axis is b (y∥b,
  x∥a*). Corrected for both the Calculator/Simulator (selected setting) and the Explorer
  (convention's standard setting).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Added a Birss/ITC symbol-convention toggle: setting labels, standard badges, group-string
  synonyms (`6'/mm'm`/`6'/mmm'`), convention-aware axis display, and in-app explanations of the
  Birss↔ITC divergences. Display-only — no computed output changes.
- Added ITC Table 1.5.7.1 as an independent (non-Birss) verification anchor for the MD-c
  (piezomagnetic) tensor class: a transcribed reference table
  (`docs/references/ITC-table-1.5.7.1-piezomagnetic.md`), a cross-validation test over 71
  group/setting entries, and 15 literature-anchored golden fixtures. Shrinks the un-anchored
  `NO_ANCHOR` set to the two grey groups (`2/m1'`, `-3m1'`, which have no MD-c tensor).
  Verification only -- no computed output changes.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Corrected the generators of `6'/mm'm`: the default-setting frame was rotated 30° from Birss
  (generator σ(4) instead of the book's σ(2)); ED-c default now yyy-family per Birss Table 7
  (A = (-62m), c-polar-odd = (R_n)); setting 2 correspondingly now xxx-family. Anchored by a new
  VERIFIED golden fixture. All other tensors of this group re-checked (i-tensors and zero cells
  unaffected by the flip).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- The complete transcribed Birss (1966) reference tables now ship in this repo under
  `birss-tables/` (merged from `manganite/birss-tables` with full history, PR #48), including the
  convention guide, the Birss–ITC comparison, the typeset PDF, and the 122-group nomenclature
  table.
- `birss-tables/tools/generate_nomenclature.py` + a CI step that regenerates
  `table-nomenclature.md` and fails on drift (PR #49).
- Audit guardrail tests: nomenclature & operator-set reference tests, grey-c≡0,
  particularization, and three hand-Birss end-to-end tests; coverage matrix in
  `docs/findings/AUDIT-convention-references.md`.

### Fixed

- Corrected the generators of six magnetic point groups, verified against Birss,
  *Symmetry and Magnetism* (1966) Table 6 (book-scan-verified operator column) via
  explicit matrix closure:
  - `6'/m'` and `6'/m` had each other's inversion time-reversal flag (unitary vs.
    primed `-1` swapped): selecting `6'/m'` incorrectly gave a non-zero ED `c`-tensor
    (should be `≡ 0`, since `6'/m'` contains the *unitary* inversion) and `6'/m`
    incorrectly gave `ED c = 0` (should be Birss Table 4e row O3, 2 independent
    components).
  - `m'-3'm'` and `m'-3'm` had each other's 4-fold generator (proper `4_z` vs.
    roto-inversion `-4_z` swapped): selecting `m'-3'm'` incorrectly gave a non-zero
    ED `c`-tensor (should be `≡ 0`, halving subgroup H = 432 forbids it) and
    `m'-3'm` incorrectly gave `ED c = 0` (should be the Td-type single-component
    form, Birss Table 4e row U3).
  - `4'/m'm'm`'s Default orientation was built in the σ/4-rotated frame
    (misoriented relative to its own `-42m` halving subgroup); the ED `c`-tensor's
    component labels were attached to the wrong axes in the Default setting.
  - `-4'm2'`'s Default orientation was likewise built in the σ/4-rotated frame:
    the ED `i`-tensor form previously (and wrongly) pinned to Setting 2 belongs to
    Default, and Setting 2 now carries the `-42m`-diagonal-mirror form instead
    (Default and Setting 2 swap).
  - All six wrong since v0.1.1. Anchored to `birss-tables` pass-5 book-scan
    corrections; `birss-tables/table-nomenclature.md` Table B regenerated
    accordingly.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Corrected two orthorhombic Type-III (black-and-white) magnetic point-group data
  errors, verified against Birss, *Symmetry and Magnetism* (1966) and cross-checked
  against ITC Vol. D Table 1.5.2.3:
  - `mmm'` and `m'm'm` had each other's generator/operator sets (unprimed vs.
    primed inversion swapped): selecting `mmm'` incorrectly gave `ED c = 0`
    (should be 7 independent components) and `m'm'm` incorrectly allowed ED-`c`
    SHG (should be forbidden). Wrong since v0.1.1.
  - `2'm'm`'s Default orientation was rotated 90° from its own HM symbol
    (`{1, m_y, 2'_z, m'_x}` instead of the Birss Table-6 form
    `{1, m_z, 2'_x, m'_y}`), affecting which axis its ED `i`- and `c`-tensor
    components are attached to in the Default setting and the corresponding
    a-/b-unique settings. Wrong since v0.1.1.
- Removed the spurious 3-setting (a-/b-unique) selector shown for `222`, `mmm`,
  `2221'`, and `mmm1'` — all three crystal axes are symmetry-equivalent for these
  groups, so the "alternate" settings were identical to the Default and offered no
  real choice. Wrong since v0.10.0.
- Generalized the orthorhombic "Axis orientation" help text to explain the
  time-reversal-driven distinguishing cases (e.g. the un-primed 2-fold in
  `2'2'2`, the primed mirror in `mmm'`), not just the classical polar/2-fold case.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Glossary tooltip layer (B20): click-to-reveal ⓘ info icons on the Tensor
  Classification (ED/MD/EQ), Time-Reversal (i-type/c-type), Crystal Setting,
  Crystal Cut, Crystal Rotation, Independent Tensor Components, SHG Intensity
  Polarimetry, and the per-tab Anisotropy/Polarizer/Analyzer controls; the
  expanded GroupIdentityHeader panel shows a type-definition tooltip (Type
  I/II/III). Each tooltip shows a 1–2 line definition and a "Learn more →" link
  that deep-links to the relevant Help tab. Source of truth lives in
  `src/data/glossary.ts` (16 terms); the reusable `<TermInfo>` component follows
  the established B19 click-toggle pattern (no hover, mobile-safe).
- Help page reorganized into 5 tabs (Feature Overview, Notations & Conventions,
  Physics & Group Theory, Simulation, Deeper Topics), matching the Calculator's
  tab-strip pattern on desktop and a horizontally-scrollable strip on mobile.
  References now live inside Deeper Topics. The "Symmetry Operations" block was
  brought in line with the rest of the page's key-terms-grid style (B14).
- Simulator now has a "Crystal Setting" selector with full parity to the Calculator's
  (same control, same labels); the selected setting persists across Calculator ↔
  Simulator navigation, resetting to the default only on group change (B2.4).
- Explorer group popup shows the number of available settings and the alternate
  setting's symbol/convention name (e.g. "2 settings — also expressible as 6'm'm");
  the Monoclinic tab explains the First/Second (c-unique Birss / b-unique ITC)
  convention (B2.2).
- Help page's "Alternate Settings" section opens with a plain-language explanation
  of what a setting is and why a group can have more than one, before the formal
  mechanism breakdown; clarifies the setting selector now appears in both the
  Calculator and the Simulator (B2.1).

### Changed
- Calculator/Simulator setting buttons for all 19 non-monoclinic dual-setting
  magnetic groups now show the distinct magnetic HM symbol (e.g. `6'm'm`, `4'm'm`,
  `-4'm'2`, `-3'1m'`, `-6'm'2`) instead of internal mechanism labels (e.g. "σ_d
  primed", "C₂' along ⟨100⟩"). The trigonal and hexagonal entries were derived
  from each group's own computed symmetry operations, using the slot convention
  confirmed against the existing `-3m`→`-31m` and `-6m2`→`-62m` pairs. Monoclinic
  alternate-setting buttons now read "First (c-unique, Birss)" / "Second
  (b-unique, ITC)" instead of "Default" / "b-unique (ITC)" for consistency with
  the Help/Explorer wording (B2.3, complete).
- Simulator's "Source Terms (Lab Frame)" panel no longer shows the redundant
  "Symbolic (φ_x, φ_y, ψ dependence)" block — it duplicated "As functions of
  E_X, E_Y" and made the panel unnecessarily long. "As functions of E_X, E_Y" and
  "As functions of θ_pol" are unchanged (A1-Sim).
- The θ_pol-swept formulas in the Simulator's "As functions of θ_pol" block and
  the expanded "Detected Intensity Formulas" now prefer the harmonic
  (Fourier-series) form over the power form by default, using the power form only
  when it is strictly shorter for that component; previously it was the other way
  around. Purely a display-form re-expression — every power↔harmonic mapping is
  mathematically exact (verified independently before the change), so no computed
  value changes. For the common case (a single tensor component contributing to
  one polarizer-angle term) the rendered output is unchanged, since the power form
  is always the shorter of the two there (B16).

### Fixed
- **Data:** the `-3'm'` magnetic point group's generator encoded the wrong unitary
  (halving) subgroup — `3m` instead of the literature-correct `32` (Birss
  *Symmetry and Magnetism* Table 6/7 row 82; independently confirmed against the
  printed International Tables for Crystallography trigonal listing). This made
  `-3'm'` collapse to a duplicate of the unrelated `-3'm` group (identical computed
  symmetry operations and tensor forms at both crystal settings). Corrected the
  generator in `symmetryGroups.ts`. **Affects previously-computed output**: the
  canonical Cr₂O₃ magnetoelectric SHG c-type ED tensor (`-3'm'`, the most-cited
  fixture in the golden-tensor suite) changes from the `M₃`-class form (nonzero
  `χ_zzz`, no `χ_xyz` term) to the literature-correct `L₃`-class form (`χ_zzz = 0`,
  `χ_xyz`-family present) — versions before this fix reported the wrong nonvanishing
  components for this group at both the default and alternate crystal setting, and
  in any rotated/lab-frame source-term display referencing it. `-3'm` and `-3m'`
  (the other two members of the trigonal `-3m` magnetic family) were verified
  unaffected. See `docs/findings/FINDING-trigonal-3m-prime-bug.md` and
  `docs/findings/verification-trigonal-magnetic-groups.md` for the full derivation.
- Help page content audit (B22): Neumann's-principle equation now shows the
  `det(R)` (axial) and time-reversal-sign (c-type) factors it was previously
  missing; dropped the misleading "provided time-reversal symmetry is broken"
  qualifier on the magnetic-dipole description (axial-tensor survival in
  centrosymmetric groups is a parity effect, independent of time reversal);
  fixed "Hausühl" → "Haussühl"; corrected the lab-frame rotation-matrix formula,
  which had drifted out of sync with the shipped order
  (`Rz(ψ)·Ry(φy)·Rx(φx)` → the actual `Ry(φy)·Rx(φx)·Rz(ψ)`); marked the
  already-open-access references and added Fiebig, Pavlov & Pisarev, JOSA B 22,
  96 (2005) to the references list. UI/docs-only — no computed values change.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Shared group-identity header in Calculator and Simulator showing: HM symbol
  with Schoenflies, crystal system, type, centrosymmetric badge, current setting,
  parent crystallographic group and halving subgroup H (Type III), one-line SHG
  consequence, and "Open in Explorer" link (B3/B27).

### Changed
- Calculator setup area uses two-column layout (Tensor Classification | Time
  Reversal side by side on md+), matching the Simulator (B4).
- Button styling unified across Calculator and Simulator: text-xs font-medium
  with icon-labeled section headers (B4).
- Grey emphasis chips dropped from section labels (B25).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Alternate settings for 11 Type I (colourless) and 11 Type II (grey) point
  groups: orthorhombic axis orientation (222, mm2, mmm — 3 settings each),
  monoclinic axis choice (2, m, 2/m — b-unique ITC), and classical Mechanism A
  (-42m, 32, 3m, -3m, -6m2 — alternate orientations), plus their grey 1'
  counterparts. The setting selector now covers all groups that have multiple
  settings. Default-setting output is unchanged.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Lab-frame orientation panel: inverse-relation toggle (↔) switches between
  "crystal axes in the lab frame" and "lab axes in the crystal frame" views.
  Info (ⓘ) button shows a legend explaining the axis symbols and their
  physical meaning.

### Changed
- Lab-frame panel title sharpened from "Crystal Orientation in Lab Frame" to
  "Crystal axes in the lab frame" (switches with the inverse toggle).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- Simulator tilt axes (φ_x, φ_y) are now lab-fixed: spinning the crystal
  (ψ) no longer drags the tilt axes. The rotation composition changes from
  R = Rz(ψ)·Ry(φ_y)·Rx(φ_x)·R_preset to R = Ry(φ_y)·Rx(φ_x)·Rz(ψ)·R_preset.
  Previously, tilts were crystal-fixed, producing wrong geometry when ψ and
  tilts were combined (since v0.3.0). At zero tilt (the default), results
  are unchanged.

### Changed
- Calculator source terms now show the angle-independent form at the selected
  cut direction, without φ_x/φ_y/ψ dependence. The Simulator retains the
  full angle-dependent symbolic form.
- Crystal cut direction selector and lab-frame panel unified into a single
  shared component with consistent naming ("Crystal Cut, surface normal ∥ k")
  across Calculator and Simulator.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Magnetic snapping on phase (15° increments) and magnitude (0.05 increments)
  sliders; Shift+Arrow for larger steps; clickable scale ticks for
  jump-to-value (B10).

### Changed
- Simulator tensor-component sliders use compact inline rows with
  always-visible phase instead of a tall vertical stack with collapsible
  phase (B6).
- Simulator polar plots enlarged (max 450px, outerRadius 80%); excess
  vertical whitespace trimmed (B18).
- Single-component groups show disabled sliders with explanatory note
  instead of interactive controls (B17).

### Fixed
- Simulator mobile layout: single-plot view with parallel/crossed toggle,
  component selector for one-at-a-time slider control; no longer overlaps
  or requires scrolling past the full setup panel (A3).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- `formatCoeff` recognises `1/√6` and renders it as `1/√6` instead of the
  decimal `0.408`. The existing `√6/3` entry now displays as `2/√6` so the
  `[111]` cubic lab-frame X-coefficients read homogeneously (display only;
  numeric values unchanged).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Explorer group popup displays the Schoenflies symbol alongside the
  Hermann-Mauguin notation for Type-I and Type-II (grey) groups.
- Explorer group popup adds an "Open in Simulator" button alongside the
  existing "Open in Calculator" link.

### Fixed
- Tensor rank badge no longer shows "RANK RANK 3" / "RANK RANK 4"; displays
  "RANK 3" / "RANK 4" as intended (since v0.4.0).
- Explorer type-column subtitles now show the count for the selected crystal
  system (e.g. "7 groups" for Hexagonal Type I) instead of the global totals
  "32 / 32 / 58" (since v0.7.0).
- Help page Feature Overview box order now matches the navigation order
  (Explorer → Calculator → Simulator).
- Tensor Notes section on mobile no longer requires a tap to expand
  (content is always visible).
- Spurious vertical scroll arrows on Calculator equation rows removed.
- Label wording standardized across Calculator and Simulator ("Tensor
  Classification", "Source Terms (Lab Frame)", "ED SHG", Unicode ∥/⊥,
  "Centrosymmetric"/"Non-Centrosymmetric").
- Tensor components panel no longer reserves excessive whitespace for
  high-symmetry groups with few components.

### Changed
- Crystal cut presets reduced to one representative per symmetry direction
  family (Blickrichtungen): Cubic shows [100], [111], [110]; Tetragonal shows
  [001], [100], [110]. Previously, symmetry-equivalent directions (e.g.
  [001]/[100]/[010] in cubic) were listed individually.

### Removed
- Free [hkl] Miller-index input for cubic groups removed. Use the curated
  presets instead (restricted to cubic only since v0.7.1).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Azimuth-zero convention for non-principal crystal cuts: preset rotation
  now includes a beam-axis offset (psi0) that anchors azimuth 0 to the
  projection of the crystal c-axis [001] onto the sample surface. This
  makes polarimetry at psi=0 reproducible and lab-independent for cuts
  like [110], [111], and arbitrary [hkl]. Principal cuts are unchanged.
  Previously, azimuth 0 was an arbitrary byproduct of the Euler
  decomposition order (wrong by up to 120° for some cuts since v0.7.0).
- Preset labels for hexagonal/trigonal systems corrected from [010] to
  [120], matching the actual crystallographic direction of the Cartesian
  y-axis. Monoclinic/triclinic labels now show [010] ∥ b* to clarify the
  reciprocal-space nature of that direction.
- Free [hkl] Miller-index input restricted to cubic point groups. For
  non-cubic systems the orthonormal-metric interpretation silently
  produced wrong geometry (since v0.7.0). Non-cubic systems use curated
  presets only.
- Free [hkl] input hidden on mobile, consistent with the presets-only
  mobile design.
- Preset highlight comparison now includes psi0 (from the azimuth-zero
  fix), preventing false highlights when angles match but psi0 differs.

### Added
- Always-visible mobile preset strip for crystal cut selection, placed
  above the results panel. Previously, cut selection on mobile required
  expanding the collapsed Source Terms section.
- Validation feedback on the [hkl] input field: red border and hint text
  on malformed input (previously silent no-op).

### Changed
- Calculator view extracted from App.tsx into CalculatorPage.tsx
  (App.tsx reduced from 910 to 322 lines).
- SimulatorPage props grouped from 24 flat props into 5 structured
  objects (TensorConfig, OrientationState, SimulationState).
- Spin-slow animation moved from inline `<style>` block to index.css.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Explorer: per-crystal-system tab strip replaces the vertical scroll of all
  7 systems. Each tab shows the group grid for one system with an axis-orientation
  reference panel below. Group popup now displays generators above the full
  symmetry operations list. (PR #23)
- Free [hkl] Miller-index input alongside curated cut presets in the Calculator.
  Type any Miller indices (e.g. "1 2 3") to orient the crystal with that surface
  normal along the beam direction — no engine changes, computed via Euler angle
  decomposition of the existing R_preset architecture. (PR #24)
- Help page: new "Deeper Topics" section covering i-type vs c-type tensors,
  lab-frame rotation angles (phiX, phiY, psi), and alternate settings concepts.

### Changed
- Calculator: classification sidebar replaced with a compact one-line group
  indicator that expands on click. Main content area now uses full viewport
  width on all screen sizes. (PR #25)
- Two-level label hierarchy: primary section headers (tensor components, induced
  response, source terms) promoted to larger/bolder styling; secondary labels
  (controls, settings) stay compact. (PR #25)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Alternate settings for all 21 remaining multi-setting magnetic point groups
  (Phase 2): 11 Mechanism A groups (tetragonal/trigonal/hexagonal via Rz(45°/30°)),
  5 orthorhombic groups with 3 axis-orientation settings (c/a/b-unique), and
  5 monoclinic groups with z-unique (Birss) / b-unique (ITC) settings. The setting
  selector UI now covers all 29 multi-setting groups (8 from Phase 1 + 21 new).
- 64 new tests: S·Sᵀ=I verification for every transformation matrix and golden
  tensor-relation fixtures for all new settings, cross-checked against Birss
  Table 7 for the three validation-anchor groups (2'm'm), (-4'm2'), (-6'2m').

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Symbolic source-term expressions: Calculator and Simulator now display SHG source
  terms as trigonometric polynomials in the three rotation angles (φ_x, φ_y, ψ)
  instead of numeric coefficients at a fixed orientation. Substituting numeric angle
  values into the symbolic expressions reproduces the previous numeric output exactly.
- New `trigPoly` algebra module for trigonometric polynomial arithmetic (addition,
  multiplication, evaluation, Pythagorean simplification) over three independent
  angles — the symbolic engine underlying the rotation-dependent source terms.
- Symbolic projection pipeline (`symbolicProjection.ts`) that runs in parallel with
  the existing numeric path: crystal-frame basis computation stays numeric, while
  lab-frame source-term contractions use symbolic rotation matrix entries.
- LaTeX formatter for TrigPoly expressions (`trigPolyFormat.ts`) using power form
  (cos²φ_x) with automatic coefficient formatting via the existing formatCoeff table.
- 158 new tests: TrigPoly algebra (31), symbolic projection cross-checks against
  numeric path (107), and LaTeX formatter (20).

### Changed
- Calculator source terms now always show symbolic φ-dependent formulas (replaces
  the previous "rotation active in Simulator" informational note).
- Simulator Mathematical Model section adds a symbolic subsection showing
  φ-dependent source terms alongside the existing E_X/E_Y and θ_pol formulas.
- `transformTensor` and `averageTensor` in tensorProjection.ts are now exported
  (previously internal) — used by the symbolic pipeline to avoid duplication.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Simulator: rotation sliders for φ_x (±90°), φ_y (±90°), and ψ (±180°) with
  coupled numeric inputs, in a collapsible Crystal Rotation section below k-vector
  presets. Polar plots update live as sliders change.
- Simulator: sticky plot column — plots stay visible while scrolling the component
  list for low-symmetry groups with many independent components.
- Simulator: condensed component blocks — phase collapsed by default when φ=0
  (non-zero value shown in collapsed header), amplitude and phase sliders have
  coupled numeric inputs for exact value entry, phase slider shows tick marks
  at 0/90/180/270/360°.
- Crystal-system-aware cut presets: k-vector buttons now show crystallographic
  labels ([001], [100], [010]) instead of abstract k∥z / k∥x / k∥y. Cubic groups
  get [110] and [111] presets; tetragonal gets [110].
- Alternate settings for 8 Mechanism-B magnetic point groups (4 tetragonal + 4
  hexagonal) where time-reversal breaks the mirror-plane equivalence. A setting
  selector appears when multiple settings exist; groups with future settings
  show a passive indicator.
- Contextual explanations for zero-result SHG states: when all source terms
  vanish (centrosymmetric + ED + i-type, or grey + c-type), an inline explanation
  with quick-action buttons (Try c-type / Try EQ / Try MD) replaces the blank
  result. Applies to both Calculator and Simulator.

### Changed
- Calculator source terms now always display at base orientation (φ_x = φ_y = ψ = 0).
  When rotation is active in the Simulator, an info note explains this and points
  to the future symbolic φ-dependent expressions.
- Mobile: Calculator drops tab bar, stacks Components + Induced Response on one
  scroll page. Source Terms is behind tap-to-expand.
- Mobile: Simulator replaces full setup panel with compact one-line summary
  (group · tensor type · TR symmetry · k-preset) that expands on tap.
- Mobile: Polarimetry tabs abbreviated ("Aniso" / "Pol" / "Ana") to prevent
  truncation.
- Mobile: Plots render above the component list with sticky positioning.
  Classification sidebar and Tensor Notes collapse on mobile.
- Mobile: Tensor Type / Time Reversal selectors collapse to a summary when at
  defaults (ED + i-type).
- Hardcoded color values (#141414, #E4E3E0) replaced with semantic `ink`/`paper`
  theme tokens throughout the codebase (~194 occurrences). No visual change.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Lab-frame rotation engine with three user-defined angles (φ_x, φ_y, ψ) for
  arbitrary crystal orientation beyond principal-axis presets. User rotations are
  applied in the lab frame, decoupled from the k-vector preset: `R = Rz(ψ) ·
  Ry(φ_y) · Rx(φ_x) · R_preset`. No UI controls yet — angles default to 0 and
  will ship with Feature 1C (rotation sliders).
- Golden reference tests for rotated SHG outputs at 8 non-zero rotation
  configurations (k∥x, k∥y, oblique) and 3 lab-frame vector presets, ensuring
  the engine refactor preserves rotated-path correctness.

### Changed
- Rotation matrix now composed from tested primitives (`rotX`, `rotY`, `rotZ`,
  `mat3mul`) instead of a hand-expanded inline formula. Identical numerical
  output at all orientations.
- `calculateSHGExpressions` and `getLabFrameVectors` accept options objects
  (`SHGOptions`, `LabFrameOptions`) instead of positional arguments (internal
  API, no user-visible change).

### Removed
- Diagonal orientation presets (k∥xy, k∥xz, k∥yz). Equivalent orientations are
  reachable via user rotation from the principal presets: k∥xy = k∥y + φ_y = −45°,
  k∥xz = k∥z + φ_y = −45°, k∥yz = k∥z + φ_x = 45°.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Document the oblique-axis Cartesian convention (Hausühl/IRE) for triclinic and
  monoclinic systems: `AxisOrientationInfo` now shows axis assignments for both
  systems (triclinic previously showed nothing), Help page includes triclinic/monoclinic
  entries and a "Why no β control?" explanation, Simulator shows an info note for
  low-symmetry groups about convention dependence and scope.
- Explorer is now the default landing view (tab order: Explorer → Calculator →
  Simulator → Help), replacing the empty Calculator state.

### Fixed

- Polar plot orientation: 0° (X) is now at the right with angles increasing
  anticlockwise (standard optics/SHG convention). Previously 0° was at the top
  with clockwise progression (since v0.1.0).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Systematic tensor verification: 21 golden fixtures covering all Birss Table 4e
  symbol classes (A3–U3) at rank 3, confirming the app reproduces every row of
  the Birss polar rank-3 tensor table exactly.

### Changed
- Switched all trigonal and hexagonal generators from x-secondary (ITC convention)
  to y-secondary (Birss convention): σ(2)=[2_y] and σ(4)=[-2_y]. This changes
  tensor component output for 17 groups (32, 3m, -3m and their 14 magnetic
  derivatives) to match the Birss tables exactly. Hexagonal 6-fold groups are
  also updated for generator fidelity (no tensor output change).

### Fixed
- Corrected Hermann–Mauguin symbols for 10 magnetic point groups (since v0.1.0):
  `-62m` → `-6m2` (Type I, and grey `-62m1'` → `-6m21'`);
  `-4'2'm` → `-4'm2'`;
  `6'/mmm'` ↔ `6'/m'mm'` name swap resolved (now `6'/m'mm'` and `6'/mm'm`);
  cubic Type III groups normalized to use consistent bar notation
  (`m'3` → `m'-3'`, `m'3m'` → `m'-3'm'`, `m'3m` → `m'-3'm`, `m3m'` → `m-3m'`).
  Generators and symmetry operations were already correct — only the display
  labels changed.
- Corrected -6m2 and -6m21' generators: changed from σ(2)=[2_y] (C₂ rotation)
  to σ(4)=[-2_y] (mirror with normal y), matching Birss Table 3. The previous
  generator produced the wrong tensor component family (L3-type instead of
  R3-type) for this group (since v0.1.0).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12
### Added
- Calculator: automatic determination of non-zero and independent ED, MD, and EQ tensor components, time-reversal symmetry toggles, real-time SHG response in the lab frame, and crystal rotation controls.
- Explorer: browse and filter all 122 magnetic point groups by crystal system and group type.
- Simulator: interactive radar-chart SHG polarimetry visualization with Fourier series simplification of intensity formulas.
- Help & Documentation page covering physics background, math derivations, and usage instructions.
- MIT license, repository description, topics, and homepage link.
