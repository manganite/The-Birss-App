# The Birss App — Agent Guidelines

> **Content:** Working agreement for anyone (human or agent) changing this repo: build, architecture, conventions, git workflow, and the documentation map.
> **Status:** living
> **Authority:** authoritative for process and conventions. Where another doc disagrees on process, this one wins.

Scientific React SPA that calculates non-zero susceptibility tensor components (ED, MD, EQ) and SHG source terms for all 32 crystallographic and 122 magnetic point groups.

## Current work (next cycle)

**Start with `STATUS.md` (root)** — the canonical index for the current cycle:
what is done, what is open, and what the standing decisions are.

Its **section 1 is the only list of open, in-scope work.** Everything deferred lives in
**`docs/planning/BACKLOG.md`**; the record of how past series were decided lives in
**`docs/planning/LEDGER.md`** (from 2026-07-31) and **`docs/planning/TODO-next.md`** (frozen
archive of everything before that). The full picture is in the documentation map below.

Working rules for this cycle:

- **Orientation-(in)dependence split** is the organising principle: the Calculator
  owns crystal-frame, orientation-free results (tensor form, induced response, source
  term *frozen at the cut*); the Simulator owns lab-frame, orientation-dependent
  results (*swept* source terms, polarimetry). Group / tensor type / time-reversal /
  setting are a shared group context.
- **Safety net first.** For any data/math item, extend the relevant golden / rotated
  fixture (`goldenTensors.fixtures.ts`, `rotatedSHG.fixtures.ts`) **first** and require
  it green, then change code. Two fixture classes with distinct rules: **correctness
  goldens** (e.g. `goldenTensors.fixtures.ts`) trace to print-verified literature, directly or
  through a calibrated derivation (the three provenance classes are set out under Architecture),
  never from app output; **behavioral regression pins** (`rotatedSHG.fixtures.ts`,
  `shgUnification.pins.test.ts`) are captured from a known-good app revision and are
  regenerated only by re-capturing from a known-good base -- never edited to turn a
  red pin green.
- **Resolve before coding.** An item tagged *Open decision* or *Derivation /
  verification pending* must have that resolved (and its `Status:` updated) before its
  implementation branch opens.
- **Verify, don't guess.** Check claims against the code (or ask) before acting;
  several `docs/planning/TODO-next.md` items are marked *provisional* for exactly this reason.
- **Ask when in doubt.** If the intent, rationale, or scope of a TODO or ROADMAP
  item is unclear, ask for clarification rather than interpreting on your own. The
  items encode specific design decisions and physics reasoning — guessing risks
  implementing the wrong thing.

## Documentation map (normative)

This section is the rule; the folder READMEs are descriptions of it. If they disagree, this wins.

### What each file is for

| file | role | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STATUS.md` | Current release, **section 1 = the only open-work list**, and the standing decisions (§ 5). | living |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Per-release user-facing changes; correction entries say what was wrong and since when it is fixed. | living |
| `README.md` | Public overview. | living |
| `AGENTS.md` | This file: process, conventions, architecture, and this map. | living |
| `SECURITY.md` | Vulnerability reporting. | living |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Pointer to this file. Non-authoritative. | living |
| `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` | The idea inventory: everything deferred, tagged and with provenance. Nothing here is scheduled. | living |
| `docs/planning/LEDGER.md` | Append-only series record from 2026-07-31 onward, plus standing observation points. | living |
| `docs/planning/TODO-next.md` | The v0.12-era working draft and the completed series ledgers (E/T/F/R/A/Q/T7-BC). The process record. | frozen |
| `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`, `ROADMAP-next.md`, `DESIGN-tables-feature.md` | Closed-out plans, kept for their reasoning. | frozen |
| `docs/findings/*` | Dated investigation records. | frozen by default |
| `docs/references/BIRSS-APP-CONVENTIONS-REFERENCE.md`, `BIRSS-ITC-CONVENTION-DIVERGENCES.md` | The app's convention contracts. | living, authoritative |
| `docs/references/DECISION-*.md` | Accepted decision records. | living |
| `docs/references/ITC-table-*.md` | Transcribed ITC tables, re-parsed by the reference tests. | source-side |
| `birss-tables/*` | **Vendored** Birss transcriptions (git subtree). | source-side |

### Authority hierarchy

1. **The app's convention contract wins over the book compilation.** Where
   `BIRSS-APP-CONVENTIONS-REFERENCE.md` and a vendored table appear to disagree about what the
   *app* does, the contract is authoritative; the vendored table is authoritative about what the
   *book* says. (Where Birss and ITC themselves diverge, Birss wins — that rule is in the contract.)
2. **`BIRSS-ITC-CONVENTION-DIVERGENCES.md` wins over `docs/findings/DISCREPANCIES.md`** on every
   symbol/setting/orientation question. The latter is partially superseded and says so.
3. **Shipped, test-guarded behaviour wins over any design document.** A frozen design record
   describes an intent, not the product.

### Vendored files

`birss-tables/` arrives by `git subtree` from `manganite/birss-tables`. Do not add app-side
banners or app-side notes to it, and change a table only to correct it against print — the
reference tests re-parse these files at test time and CI regenerates `table-nomenclature.md` from
the generator and fails on drift.

### Where a decision goes

- **Convention or data-model decision** → `docs/references/DECISION-*.md`, dated. Superseded by a
  later dated decision, never edited in place.
- **A constraint that binds future work** → `STATUS.md` § 5 (standing decisions).
- **A decision made while executing a series** → the series entry in `LEDGER.md`. If it turns out
  to bind work beyond that series, promote it to § 5 and leave a pointer.

### Freeze discipline

- A **frozen** document changes only by a dated addendum or a supersession line in its banner.
  Its body is not rewritten — that is the whole point of freezing it.
- **Open state lives in `STATUS.md` § 1 and nowhere else.** A live item inside a frozen file is a
  bug; move it out (that is why T-obs moved to `LEDGER.md`).
- **Ledgers are append-only.** Correct an entry with a dated follow-up beneath it.

### Maintenance rule

Adding a new documentation file means, in the same commit: the three-line banner at the top, and
a line for it in the containing folder's `README.md`. Add both to the self-check of any work order
that creates documentation.

## Build & Dev

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run build        # production build → dist/
npm run lint         # TypeScript type-check only (tsc --noEmit)
npm run test         # run the Vitest suite once
npm run test:watch   # run Vitest in watch mode
npm run test:reference    # literature / vendored-table reference guards only
npm run test:audit        # audit-era exhaustive coverage checks only
npm run test:pins         # engine-derived behavioral regression pins only
npm run test:interaction  # jsdom interaction layer only
npm run deploy       # build + publish to GitHub Pages via gh-pages
```

### Test taxonomy (by filename suffix)

The suite encodes its test classes in the filename, selectable via the convenience scripts
above (substring filters on the vitest CLI). `npm run test` always runs everything and remains
the only gate -- the scripts are local tools, never CI lanes, so no file can silently escape CI
through a filter gap.

- `*.reference.test.ts` -- re-parse frozen literature / vendored tables at test time and assert
  the app equals them entry-for-entry. Red means the app's data or engine drifted from print
  (or the vendored table changed). Useful as a fast FIRST check after touching group data,
  tensor logic, or anything under `birss-tables/` -- but note it is only the reference-table
  SUBSET: goldens (`goldenTensors.test.ts`), the notation drift guards
  (`groupNotation.test.ts`, `pointGroups.test.ts`), the audits, and the convention/setting
  tests live outside this filter. Full assurance is `npm run test`, as always.
- `*.audit.test.ts` -- audit-era exhaustive coverage contracts. Red means a coverage guarantee
  broke.
- `*.pins.test.ts` -- engine-derived behavioral regression pins (see "Safety net first" above):
  captured from a known-good revision; regenerate only by re-capture, never edit to green.
- `*.interaction.test.tsx` -- the jsdom interaction layer (per-file `@vitest-environment jsdom`
  docblocks; the rest of the suite runs in the node environment). Run when touching hooks or UI
  wiring. NOTE: accessible-name queries are unusable against `<App/>` under jsdom (KaTeX MathML
  vs getComputedStyle -- see the App.interaction docblock).
- Unsuffixed `*.test.ts(x)` -- unit, service, golden-fixture and SSR-smoke tests; mixed weight
  (this class contains the heaviest sweeps).

Known naming impurities, documented rather than renamed: `groupNotation.test.ts` and
`pointGroups.test.ts` are drift guards by content (they parse `table-nomenclature.md`) despite
plain names; `sharingPartitions.reference.test.ts` guards GENERATED data rather than literature;
`handBirss.e2e.test.ts` is a named acceptance checkpoint, not a browser E2E test.

### The gates

**Five commands, and the list is quoted in full or not at all.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
them in this order on every push and pull request:

1. `npm run lint` — `tsc --noEmit`
2. `npm run lint:eslint` — `eslint .`
3. `npm run format:check` — `prettier --check .`
4. `npm run build`
5. `npm run test`

CI additionally regenerates `birss-tables/table-nomenclature.md` from
`birss-tables/tools/generate_nomenclature.py` and fails on drift.

A work report that says "gates green" **cites all five by name**. If one is deliberately skipped, the
skip is stated in the report — a shortened list is indistinguishable from a complete one at a glance,
which is the Erratum-11 enumeration rule applied to process rather than to data. Adopted 2026-08-03
after a branch reached review with `lint:eslint` and `format:check` red and three gates reported
green; the prose this sentence replaced named only two of the five, and the executor never opened
`ci.yml` to check.

Tests for `tensorCalculator.ts` live in `src/services/tensorCalculator.test.ts` and cover: group-order sanity for all 122 point groups, parity invariants (e.g. ED vanishes for centrosymmetric groups, EQ never vanishes, grey groups `G1'` reproduce `G` for i-type), and `formatCoeff`/`isCentrosymmetric` unit tests, plus the convention-audit guardrails: the ~150 golden fixtures of `goldenTensors.fixtures.ts` (provenance classes below), the two reference tests (`nomenclature.reference.test.ts`, `operatorSet.reference.test.ts` — parse `birss-tables/table-nomenclature.md` at test time), the grey-c≡0 and particularization checks, and three hand-Birss end-to-end tests (`handBirss.e2e.test.ts`); see `docs/findings/AUDIT-convention-references.md` for the full coverage matrix.

`src/services/goldenTensors.fixtures.ts` + `goldenTensors.test.ts` extend this with golden component-relation fixtures for **every Type-III crystal family**, c-type ED (incl. the canonical Cr2O3 `-3'm'` magnetoelectric SHG tensor), and the axial (MD) `det(g)` branch — each pinning down the *identity* of a hand-curated `GENERATORS` entry, not just its order or invariants.

### Fixture provenance classes

Not every "golden" carries the same authority, and the distinction matters when one goes red. Three classes, in descending strength — the class is what a fixture's `source`/`note` field records, and the policy below is unchanged, only stated precisely:

- **(a) Direct print-verified.** The expected values were read off a printed source and cross-checked against it entry for entry: the vendored table transcriptions re-parsed by `*.reference.test.ts`, the Hoshi 1995 EQ goldens, the Yariv Table 16.1 scheme transcription, and the 11 `goldenTensors` fixtures carrying a `// VERIFIED:` comment (signed off against printed Birss Table 4e, 2026-07-02). A red one of these means the app disagrees with print.
- **(b) Analytically derived, calibrated against (a).** Most of the ~150 `goldenTensors` fixtures: derived from each group's generators via the rank-3/4 transformation law (Birss, *Symmetry and Magnetism* (1966), eq. 3.22/3.27), independently re-implemented and calibrated against the six pre-existing fixtures; F4 sign-off 2026-07-09 (`docs/findings/SIGNOFF-rank3-verify-2026-07-09.md`). These are strong, and they are **not** the same thing as a book read — the derivation shares an author with the code it guards, which is exactly why the calibration subset exists. A red one means the app disagrees with an independent re-implementation of the transformation law.
- **(c) Behavioral pins.** `*.pins.test.ts` and `rotatedSHG.fixtures.ts`: captured from a known-good software state. **Regression detectors only, never correctness authority.** They are regenerated by re-capture from a known-good base and never edited to turn a red pin green. A red one means behaviour changed — whether for better or worse is a separate question the pin cannot answer.

Class (a) and (b) together are the correctness goldens of the anti-circularity rule; class (c) is the other side of that rule's two-class split. Where earlier wording called the whole `goldenTensors` set "literature-anchored" or "table-anchored", read class (b) with an (a) calibration subset.

```

All cross-page state (selected group, tensor type, time-reversal, rotation angles, amplitudes, phases) lives in `App.tsx` and is passed down via grouped prop objects (`TensorConfig`, `OrientationState`, `SimulationState` from `types.ts`). There is no state management library.

### `services/` module dependency direction

**This section is derived from a complete enumeration of the intra-`src` imports of every
non-test module in `src/services/`, not maintained by hand.** Regenerate it after any change to
the import graph; a map patched from memory drifts, and this one had (before 2026-07-31).

The graph is a DAG with six layers. A module may import from any layer below it and never from
its own or above — the two long-standing rules, *formatting may import physics but never the
reverse* and *the symbolic path imports from the numeric path but never the other way round*,
are both consequences of that layering rather than separate conventions.

| layer | modules | imports from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `tolerances`, `trigPoly`, `simulatorEngine` | nothing in `src` |
| 1 | `symmetryGroups` | `tolerances` |
| 1 | `linalg` | `trigPoly` |
| 2 | `tensorProjection` | `symmetryGroups`, `linalg`, `tolerances` |
| 2 | `conventionMapping` | `symmetryGroups` |
| 3 | `tensorForms` | `symmetryGroups`, `tensorProjection`, `linalg` |
| 3 | `symbolicProjection` | `trigPoly`, `tensorProjection`, `linalg`, `symmetryGroups` |
| 3 | `latexFormatting` | `symmetryGroups`, `tensorProjection` |
| 3 | `propertyFlags` | `symmetryGroups`, `tensorProjection`, `data/` |
| 3 | `orientation` | `tensorProjection` |
| 3 | `orientationScene` | `tensorProjection`, `tolerances` |
| 3 | `groupSearch` | `conventionMapping`, `data/` |
| 4 | `nyeScheme` | `tensorForms` (type-only), `tensorProjection` |
| 4 | `trigPolyFormat` | `trigPoly`, `tensorProjection`, `symbolicProjection` (type-only), `tolerances` |
| 5 | `tensorCalculator` | the barrel — re-exports from seven of the above |

What each module is for, and the constraints that are not visible in the graph:

- **`tolerances.ts`** — the shared numeric epsilons. Layer 0 by design: an epsilon that lives
  next to one of its users drifts from the others.
- **`symmetryGroups.ts`** — `Matrix3x3`, the `GENERATORS` table, matrix algebra
  (`multiply`/`det`), group closure + caching, `isCentrosymmetric`, `getSymmetryOperations`, and
  the re-exported `EPSILON`/`AXIS_EPSILON` (kept re-exported so the many existing import sites
  stay unchanged — the definitions moved to `tolerances`).
- **`linalg.ts`** — `rref`, `spanRank`, `isIndependentOf` and the pivot epsilons, the numeric 3×3
  rotations, and the symbolic `TrigMat3` helpers. The `trigPoly` dependency comes from that last
  group only; the numeric half is independent of it.
- **`orientationScene.ts`** — the scene model behind the Simulator's sample-orientation widget:
  slab corners, camera-facing faces, the two triads and the anchor corner, already projected into
  SVG units. Like `nyeScheme` it is a VIEW over an existing derivation, not a second one — its
  rotation matrix is `tensorProjection.composeOrientationMatrix`, so the picture and the
  crystal-axes equation box cannot disagree.
- **`tensorProjection.ts`** — the numeric projection core (`calculateTensorBasisResults`,
  `calculateSHGExpressions`, `getLabFrameVectors`, `transformTensor`/`averageTensor`), the Q0
  constraint partition (`reducedPartition`, `formatReducedRelations`,
  `formatCompositeConstraint`), plus the dependency-free leaf helpers (`getIndices`, `getLabel`,
  `formatCoeff`, `cleanupExpressionSigns`). Those leaves are needed both here and by
  `latexFormatting`; per the "shared utilities live in the lower module" rule they are defined
  here, so `latexFormatting` can depend on `tensorProjection` without a reverse edge.
- **`tensorForms.ts`** — `computeTensorForm`, the rank-parametrized generalization of
  `calculateTensorBasisResults`, plus the form signatures behind the sharing partitions.
- **`nyeScheme.ts`** — the dot-diagram view model. A view over `reducedPartition`, deliberately
  not a second derivation of it, so the diagram and the relation list cannot disagree.
- **`trigPoly.ts`** — trigonometric polynomial representation (`TrigPoly`) and algebra
  (`trigAdd`, `trigMul`, `trigEval`, `trigSimplify`) for three rotation angles.
- **`symbolicProjection.ts`** — `calculateSymbolicSHGExpressions`: builds a symbolic rotation
  matrix with preset angles numeric and user angles symbolic, then contracts source terms with
  `TrigPoly` coefficients.
- **`trigPolyFormat.ts`** / **`latexFormatting.ts`** — the two LaTeX renderers, for the symbolic
  and numeric paths respectively.
- **`propertyFlags.ts`**, **`conventionMapping.ts`**, **`orientation.ts`**, **`groupSearch.ts`**,
  **`simulatorEngine.ts`** — leaf services for the Explorer, the convention toggle, the crystal
  cut and the polarimetry sweep.
- **`tensorCalculator.ts`** — a barrel. It only re-exports and should stay short.

## Key Conventions

### Convention references (authoritative — read before touching group data or tensor logic)
The following cross-linked documents are the single source of truth for how the
app maps onto the Birss/ITC conventions:
- **`docs/references/BIRSS-APP-CONVENTIONS-REFERENCE.md`** — the convention contract &
  verification ladder. Self-contained: axis orientation per crystal system, the σ(0)–σ(9)
  generator pool, bracketed/rotated groups, tensor particularization, and a per-step
  anti-circular test. Where Birss and ITC diverge, **Birss wins**.
- **`birss-tables/table-nomenclature.md`** — the 122-group table: app key → Schoenflies
  → full HM → Shubnikov → symmetry operators → generators σ(N)/σ'(N) → type, with every
  App↔Birss↔ITC divergence flagged.
- **`docs/references/BIRSS-ITC-CONVENTION-DIVERGENCES.md`** — authoritative for all
  Birss↔ITC symbol/orientation questions: the two string divergences, the 30° position-2
  offset (trigonal/hexagonal), monoclinic c-vs-b, and Birss's Table-7 parenthesis
  (rotated-axes) semantics. Consult before interpreting ITC sources or any user report of
  a "wrong" symbol/component. Evidence record:
  `docs/findings/SESSION-FINDINGS-2026-07-04-6pmmpm-and-table7.md`.

Together they trace the chain **app key → Schoenflies / full HM → operators / generators →
tensor form**. All expected values are anchored to the frozen Birss tables (`birss-tables/`,
in-repo) or ITC 1.5.2.3 — **never** derived from the app's own output (anti-circularity).

### Physics / Domain
- **Tensor types**: `'ED'` (Electric Dipole, χ²), `'MD'` (Magnetic Dipole), `'EQ'` (Electric Quadrupole).
- **Time-reversal**: `'i'` = time-even (i-type), `'c'` = time-odd (c-type). Represented by `TensorTimeReversal` in `tensorCalculator.ts`.
- **Point group types**: `'I'` Standard (32), `'II'` Gray (32), `'III'` Black & White (58) — defined in `PointGroupData.type`.
- Light propagates along the **Z-axis** in the Lab Frame → `E_Z = 0` by convention throughout.
- Crystal rotation is parameterised by **phiX**, **phiY** (lab-fixed tilts) and **psi** (crystal-tied azimuth), in degrees -- see `trigPoly.ts` / `tensorProjection.ts` for the composition `R = Ry(phiY) * Rx(phiX) * Rz(psi) * R_preset`.
- Anti-unitary operations (time-reversal combined) are flagged via `isAntiUnitary?: boolean` on the `Matrix3x3` interface.

### Math rendering
- All in-line math uses `<InlineMath math="..." />` from `react-katex`.
- Block math uses `<BlockMath math="..." />`.
- `import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css'` is required wherever KaTeX components are used.
- The `FormatPointGroup` component converts Hermann–Mauguin notation to KaTeX (e.g. `-6` → `\bar{6}`).

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, not the classic PostCSS config).
- Global palette: background `#E4E3E0`, foreground/text `#141414`.
- No CSS Modules, no Styled Components. All styling is inline Tailwind utility classes.
- One custom utility in `index.css`: `.overline` for text-decoration.
- **Section header pattern**: `text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-ink/70 flex items-center gap-2` — use the shared `SectionHeader` component from `notation.tsx` rather than inlining this string.

### Component patterns
- All page components receive state as grouped prop objects from `App.tsx` (`TensorConfig`, `OrientationState`, etc.) — no Context API or Zustand.
- `useMemo` is used extensively in `SimulatorPage.tsx` and `App.tsx` for expensive tensor calculations.
- Animations use `motion` from `motion/react` (Framer Motion v12), with `AnimatePresence` for exit animations.
- Icons come exclusively from `lucide-react`.

### Path aliases
- `@/*` maps to `src/` (defined in both `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`).

## Git Workflow & Releases

Single-maintainer project using **GitHub Flow + Semantic Versioning**. `main` is
always shippable (and CI-checked via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), but merging to it
does **not** by itself go live — the deployed site only updates on a `vX.Y.Z` release
tag (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). This decouples "merged" from "released":
`main` can accumulate tested changes, and going live is the deliberate act of cutting
a release (see "Cutting a release" below). **Never commit directly to `main`.**

### GitHub hygiene
Regularly check the GitHub repository for items that need attention:
- **PR review comments** (Copilot, human reviewers) — address before merging.
- **Code scanning alerts** — fix promptly; CodeQL runs on every push to `main` and weekly.
- **Dependabot alerts and PRs** — review vulnerability alerts and routine version-update PRs.
- **Open issues** — triage and respond.

### Branches
- Every change goes through a short-lived branch, merged back into `main` with
  `--no-ff` (keeps a merge commit marking the change as a unit) and deleted
  afterward. There is no `develop` branch.
- Prefixes (lowercase, words separated by hyphens):

  | Prefix      | Purpose                                     | Example                          |
  |-------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
  | `feature/`  | New functionality                           | `feature/domain-export`          |

### Merging: local merge vs. pull request

Use the merge method that fits the risk level of the change:

| Change type | Method | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Physics output (generators, tensor logic, group data) | **Pull request** | Gets Copilot review, CodeQL runs pre-merge, creates auditable record for changes that affect calculated results |
| New features, UI changes, refactors touching multiple files | **Pull request** | Benefits from automated review and a visible diff summary |
| Chores (CI config, dependency bumps, doc formatting, typos) | **Local merge** | Low risk, no review needed, faster |

**Pull request workflow:**
```bash
git push -u origin feature/<short-name>
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
# Wait for Copilot review + CI checks; address comments
# Merge via GitHub UI (use "Create a merge commit", not squash)
# Delete remote branch via GitHub UI
git switch main && git pull
git branch -d feature/<short-name>
```

**Post-verdict commits on an already-reviewed branch.** Once a branch has a clean review verdict,
a further commit normally needs a delta re-review before merging. It may merge without that second
round-trip only when **all four** of these hold:

1. it is **docs- or comment-only** (no change to any executed code path);
2. it is **responsive** to a review comment or a verdict note (not new, self-directed scope);
3. it stays **within the paths already enumerated** by the work order or the review ledger; and
4. the **merge report quotes the diff**, so the merge record shows exactly what was added after
   the verdict.

Anything failing one of the four — including a one-line code fix, however trivial — goes back for
a delta re-review.

**Local merge workflow** (still merges a branch — never commit directly on main):
```bash
# Before merging: ensure `npm run lint && npm run test` pass locally
git switch main && git pull
git merge --no-ff feature/<short-name>
git branch -d feature/<short-name>
git push origin main
```

### Versioning
- The app version (`package.json` `version`) is injected into the footer via Vite's `define` (`__APP_VERSION__`, declared in `src/vite-env.d.ts`). Keep `package-lock.json`'s top-level `version` in sync (`npm install --package-lock-only`).
- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

  | Change                                        | Bump  | Example           |
  |------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------|
  | New feature                                     | MINOR | `v1.2.0 → v1.3.0` |
  | Corrected error in calculated output            | PATCH | `v1.3.0 → v1.3.1` |
  | Incompatible change to output format/values     | MAJOR | `v1.3.1 → v2.0.0` |

### Changelog
- On every user-facing change (behavior, UI, or capability — Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed in the Keep a Changelog sense), add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`. For corrections to calculated output, record **what** was wrong and **from which version** it's fixed — needed to interpret old results correctly later. Internal-only changes (chores, tests, CI, tooling/config with no runtime effect) generally don't need an entry.

### Cutting a release
1. Bump `version` in `package.json`/`package-lock.json`.
2. Move the `Unreleased` entries under a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, and update the compare/release links at the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Bump `STATUS.md`'s current-release block (the `## Current release: vX.Y.Z` heading, its one-line summary, the `_Last updated:_` date, and demote the previous release to a `### vX.Y.Z` past entry). Keeps the canonical cycle index from going stale.
4. Commit, then on `main`: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..."` and `git push origin main --tags`.
5. Pushing the tag triggers two workflows: `release.yml` creates the GitHub Release automatically, using the matching `## [x.y.z]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` as the release notes; `deploy.yml` builds and publishes the tagged commit to GitHub Pages — this is the point where the live site actually updates.

### Commit messages
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): lowercase summary`, e.g. `feat(simulator): add polarimetry tooltip`. Common types are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`. Scope is optional and usually the affected component/module. Keep the summary line short (~72 chars); use the body for details.
- For fixes affecting calculated output, mention which output values are affected.

### License
- MIT (`LICENSE` at repo root). Keep the `@license SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` header in `App.tsx` consistent with this.

### Release checklist
- [ ] All feature/fix branches merged (`--no-ff`) and deleted
- [ ] `main` up to date locally (`git pull`)
- [ ] `npm run lint && npm run test` pass
- [ ] Version bumped per SemVer
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated
- [ ] `STATUS.md` current-release block bumped (heading, summary, `_Last updated:_`, previous release demoted)
- [ ] Tag created and pushed with `--tags` (triggers the GitHub Release via `release.yml` and the live deploy via `deploy.yml`)

## Important Constraints

- **No backend**: all tensor math runs client-side in `tensorCalculator.ts`. Do not add server-side routes.
- **PWA**: the app registers a service worker (`vite-plugin-pwa`). Manifest assets (`favicon.svg`, `icon-192.svg`, `icon-512.svg`) live in `public/`. Do not rename or remove them.
- **TypeScript strict mode is on** (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`), enforced by `npm run lint` in CI.
- **Vitest is the test framework** — see `npm run test` above. Do not switch to Jest or another runner without explicit instruction.
